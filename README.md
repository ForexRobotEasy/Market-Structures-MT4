### Input Parameters

- `bosPeriod` (default: 10): The period for detecting BoS patterns.

1. Maps the indicator buffer.
2. Sets the indicator parameters, such as style, arrow, and empty value.
3. Sets the indicator label.

### Indicator Calculation

The indicator iteration function `OnCalculate()` is responsible for calculating the indicator values. It detects BoS patterns based on the high prices of the market. For each bar, it checks if a BoS pattern is present and plots the pattern accordingly.

### BoS Pattern Detection

The `IsBoSPattern()` function is used to check if a BoS pattern is present at a given index. It compares the high prices of the current and surrounding bars to determine if a pattern is detected.
